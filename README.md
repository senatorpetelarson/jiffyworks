JiffyWorks
==========
##Pete Larson's javascript framework.

There is a lot of documentation in site.js.coffee so for now you'll need to look through that file. If you're using codekit to compile, make sure that site.js.coffee imports jiffyworks.js.coffee as "prepend" - using the default "append" won't work.

Greensock's Tweening library is included by default. I highly recommend using this instead of jQuery to animate.
